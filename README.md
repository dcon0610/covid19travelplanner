## User Story
Our company has started to return to normalcy and wish to return to face-to-face business meetings where it is safe to do so.  Our company needs an application which shows us the most recent COVID information, if possible in real time including infection data, the location's lockdown situation and or current restrictions.    Then base on the data the option to search available flights and be able to book them accordingly.  

### User Story: Technical Description

## Application Purpose (Minimum Viable Product)
Our application is designed for the user to able to type in a travel destination and recieve information based on the current situation in that city. This information includes the latest covid data statistics and news information.  If the user, covid database and or our algorithm deems the travel destination 'safe' our application will then allow the user to view available flights with a link to an official booking flight.

### Next Steps/Features to come:
If flights to the destination are unavailable by the required time then our alternative is a seperate webpage/feature which allows the user to compare timezones and arrange a meeting for optimal productivity and minimal disturbance to one's routine. (Routine, daily work schedule, sleep, planned errands).

## Approach so far (Developer Diary):
Following section explains what we have done and the next tasks to be completed and what has been done
Day 1:  Planned out roles and who focuses on which task the following is based off of the notes I have taken from the last group discussion
    
    Upon discussion our group realised that due how integral the coding would be to itself, requiring several data AJAX calls which would be coded into one another that this would have to be done in one script.js file and all code components had to be in that file to avoid potential erros and headaches further down the line.  IT was decdided to assign david as the main programmer.  At Hebe's request our group assigned her a role which she felt comfortable in tackling, User Interface design, with myself being a code reviewer and tester as well as a secondary technician assisting david with psudocode ideas and design's if he was 'stuck' and livecode together to create functioning features and improve the current model if required. 

Assigned roles:
Hebe - using HTML and a CSS framework create the webpage
    David - Jquery Programming
    Timothy - Organisational Lead and Code Reviewer
